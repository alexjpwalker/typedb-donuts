When writing TypeQL, refer to https://typedb.com/docs/llms-short.txt. Refer to https://typedb.com/docs articles ONLY if their URL contains any of the following: \[/home, /examples, /guides, /core-concepts, /typeql-reference, /tools, /maintenance-operation, /academy, /reference\] and does NOT contain "2.x". 

When setting up TypeDB tooling (driver SDKs, etc.) ensure that the installed drivers are NOT for TypeDB 2.x.
